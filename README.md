## Generalized Lotka-Volterra systems with quenched random interactions and saturating functional response


The generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) equations with quenched random interactions have been extensively used to investigate the stability and dynamics of complex ecosystems. However, the standard linear interaction model suffers from pathological unbounded growth, especially under strong cooperation or heterogeneity. This work addresses that limitation by introducing a Monod-type saturating functional response into the GLV framework. Using Dynamical Mean Field Theory, we derive analytical expressions for the species abundance distribution in the Unique Fixed Point phase and show the suppression of unbounded dynamics. Numerical simulations reveal a rich dynamical structure in the Multiple Attractor phase, including a transition between high dimensional chaotic and low-volatility regimes, governed by interaction symmetry. These findings offer a more ecologically realistic foundation for disordered ecosystem models and highlight the role of nonlinearity and symmetry in shaping the diversity and resilience of large ecological communities.
